This module is a subclass of Email::Simple which does not fold the
headers according to RFC2822 but instead outputs every header
as one single line. 

This is necessary when using the append_string method of Mail::IMAPClient 
to add messages to an IMAP mailbox, because when the Received: header
is folded the folded lines trigger some newline business and I find
that the rest of the headers are now part of the message.

I consider the bug to be in the IMAP server I'm using (CommuniGate Pro), because it 
should be able to handle the correctly formatted message.
